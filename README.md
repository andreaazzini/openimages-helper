# OpenImages Helper

Python script to help you download the OpenImages dataset.
Make sure to adapt the script to your needs. I kept the standard directory structure of OpenImages.
In the script, change `BASE_DIR` and the destination folders of the downloaded images.

For the moment, the script is told to read the labels you're interested in from a `classes.txt` file you need to place in the root of this project.

```
tomato
potato
asparagus
pumpkin
zucchini
```
